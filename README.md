# Description

This is a minimal and interactive page with radial scrollbar. It has dynamic navigation that activates and moves based on user scroll and it uses Intersection Observer API, along with GSAP and smooth scrollbar library.
For the sake of my brain I can't use react to create this yet but I'm trying :))) wait for it
